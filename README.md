Selenium + Python = yay?
========================

A starter project to crawl a public elections website, which didn't particularly want to be crawled. Context clicks disabled. Actual file resources obscured behind session-based and dynamically generated unique IDs which JavaScript assigned on page load..

I mean, all I really wanted was the data And so I got to learn Selenium.

This script changes browser default behavior, manipulates and cleans strings while assigning unique filenames, and is even nice to the browser instance and the server on the other end. Because I'm nice like that.
